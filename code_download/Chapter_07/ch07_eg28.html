<div>If you want to create parts of pages that stretch and shrink to fit the size of users' screens, then the max-height and min-height properties are very useful because they allow you to create boxes that can change in size. The max-height property will stop a box being so tall for a layout if the window is narrow, and the min-height will help ensure that a box is not too short for a layout.</div>

  <p>On this part of the page might be some text that relates to the cheese chart above, but does not actually give you the figures that are in the graphic.</p>
  <p>This can pose a problem because, while a screen reader might be able to read the text to someone who cannot see this web page, the screen reader cannot read the graph.</p>
